# An Embedded System Project 8051

Fully Automated Street Light Control System MicroContoler 8051.

AIM
To build a embedded system to control the street light automatically as per the time and the traffic present in its vicinity.

Hardware Used
1.	AT89c51 micro controller
2.	ADC0804 Single Channel 8 bit Analog to Digital Converter
3.	7 Segment BCD
4.	1nf Capacitor
5.	10k Resistor
6.	LED Lamps 12V Load 24 Ohms
7.	LDR Sensor
8.	Electrical Relays

Software Development Tools Used:
1.  Keil IDE c51v805
2.  Proteus 8

Instructions to run simulation:

1. Load the given "Code" file in your Keil IDE
2. Compile and Build Hex File at 12MHz.
3. Download and open Proteus 8 project file .
4. Double Click in U1 AT89c51 Block and go to the Program file cloumn and select the generated Hex file in Step 2.
5. Change the frequency to 12MHz.
6. Click OK and Run the simulation.
